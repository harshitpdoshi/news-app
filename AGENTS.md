 ## Product Overview

 **Product Name:** Agents Platform  
 **Version:** 1.0.0  
 **Description:** A robust platform for managing and orchestrating intelligent agents in distributed environments.  

 ### Objectives

 - Provide a scalable API for creating, monitoring, and controlling agent workloads.
 - Ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and observability.
 - Enable plugin-based extensions and integrations with external services.

 ## Project Overview

 **Repository:** `git@github.com:your-org/agents.git`  
 **Branching Strategy:** Gitflow-like model with `main`, `develop`, feature, release, and hotfix branches.  

 ### Scope

 - Core REST API services for agent lifecycle management.
 - Authentication and authorization via OAuth2 / JWT.
 - Plugin system for custom agent behaviors.
 - Web dashboard for real-time monitoring.

 ## Technical Details

 ### Architecture

 The Agents Platform follows a microservice-oriented architecture:

 1. **API Gateway**: Central entrypoint for all external requests.
 2. **Core Agent Service**: Manages agent registration, state, and lifecycle.
 3. **Plugin Runner**: Executes custom agent logic in isolated environments.
 4. **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ for asynchronous task distribution.
 5. **Observability Stack**: Prometheus + Grafana + ELK for metrics and logs.

 ### Technology Stack

+ **Programming Language:** Go 1.21+
+ **TUI Framework:** Bubble Tea + Bubbles
+ **Markdown Renderer:** Glamour
+ **Database:** SQLite (local file)
+ **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

 ### Python Environment (uv)

 We use **uv** for managing isolated Python development environments.

 1. **Install uv**  
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    ```

 2. **Create an environment**  
    ```bash
    uv env create
    ```

 3. **Activate the environment**  
    ```bash
    uv env activate
    ```

 4. **Install dependencies**  
    ```bash
    uv install
    ```

 5. **Run tests**  
    ```bash
    uv run pytest
    ```

 ### Dependencies

 All Python dependencies are declared in `pyproject.toml`. Key dependencies:

 - `fastapi`
 - `uvicorn`
 - `sqlalchemy`
 - `pydantic`
 - `alembic`
 - `pytest`

 ```

 ## Development Environment Setup

 1. Clone the repository:  
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:your-org/agents.git
    cd agents
    ```
 2. Follow the [Python Environment (uv)](#python-environment-uv) steps above.
 3. Configure environment variables in `.env` (see `.env.example`).
 4. Apply database migrations:  
    ```bash
    uv run alembic upgrade head
    ```
5. Start the services for local development:  
    ```bash
    uv run docker-compose up
    ```

6. Build and run the CLI TUI application (requires Go 1.21+):
    ```bash
    go build -o news-app ./cmd/news-app/main.go
    ./news-app
    ```

 ## Development Workflow

 - Create feature branches off `develop`.
 - Open pull requests targeting `develop` for feature development.
 - Main branch (`main`) is protected; merges only via approved pull requests.
 - Code reviews required: at least one approval and passing CI checks.
 - Follow Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
